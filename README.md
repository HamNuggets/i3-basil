# i3-basil
A custom config of i3 window manager that can be installed as an alternative to the original i3 window manager. Additional features that this build of i3 brings are custom keybindings, a Windows-style screenshot tool (kinda), not being ugly, gaps, polybar, custom notifications, and an overall clean feel and look.
